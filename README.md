The Redemption Optimization (TRO) — Complete Replication & Manuscript Pack

This repository contains the full replication and reference materials for The Redemption Optimization: Margan’s Optimization Paradox and the Problem of Evil by Sergiu Margan.

The project introduces the Margan Optimization Framework and Margan’s Optimization Paradox (MOP), formally proving that evil is necessary only once to ground redemption goods (mercy, justice), after which every repetition adds only cost without new value.

This repository now includes:

Core Replication Materials — theorem sketch, evaluator equation, simulation results with optimality curves, and proofs confirming that “one rejection per class” is both sufficient and optimal.

Full Manuscript (Peer-Review Ready) — a comprehensive theoretical exposition with background, formal model, proofs, and philosophical implications (as published on PhilArchive).

Simulation Summary — step-by-step description of parameters, replication process, and interpretation.


This combined pack is intended for academic citation, peer review, and practical implementation across theology, ethics, AI alignment, governance, healthcare, law, and other applied systems..
