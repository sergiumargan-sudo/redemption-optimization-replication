The Redemption Optimization (TRO) — Complete Replication, Manuscript & Companion Pack

This repository contains the full replication, manuscript, and companion materials for The Redemption Optimization: Margan’s Optimization Paradox and the Problem of Evil by Sergiu Margan.

The project introduces the Margan Optimization Framework and Margan’s Optimization Paradox (MOP), formally proving that evil is necessary only once to ground redemption goods (mercy, justice). Every repetition beyond the first adds cost without generating new value.

This repository now includes:

Core Replication Materials — theorem sketch, evaluator equation, simulation results with optimality curves, and proofs confirming that “one rejection per class” is both sufficient and optimal.

Full Manuscript (Peer-Review Ready) — a comprehensive theoretical exposition with background, formal model, proofs, and philosophical implications (as published on PhilArchive).

Companion Paper — The Necessary Fall — a theological and philosophical companion demonstrating why one rebellion was historically, theologically, and epistemically inevitable, grounding mercy and justice for all of creation.

Simulation Summary — step-by-step description of parameters, replication process, and interpretation.


This combined pack is intended for academic citation, peer review, and applied implementation across theology, ethics, AI alignment, governance, healthcare, law, and other domains where freedom and justice must coexist.
