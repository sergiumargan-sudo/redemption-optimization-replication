# The Redemption Optimization (TRO) — Replication Pack  

This repository contains the replication materials for *The Redemption Optimization: Margan’s Optimization Paradox and the Problem of Evil* by **Sergiu Margan**.  

The project introduces the **Margan Optimization Paradox (MOP)** and proves that evil is necessary only once to ground redemption goods (mercy, justice), but every repetition adds only cost without value. This framework builds a formal bridge between theology, ethics, and applied systems (AI alignment, governance, healthcare, law, etc.).

## Contents  

- **TRO_Combined_with_Graphs.pdf**  
  The core replication document.  
  - Contains **simulation results** showing the “evil only once” optimality curve (objective J peaking at a single rejection, then declining).  
  - Includes the **formal evaluator equation**:  
    \[
    J = Σ(α∆L + γ∆F + μM + νJv) − Σ(βH + κR)
    \]  
  - Provides a **theorem sketch** of **Minimal-Trigger Optimality (MOP)**: under typal/concave credits with κ>0, J is maximized at n=1; repeats add costs but no new value.  
  - Visual graphs and proofs confirm that “one rejection per class” is sufficient and optimal.  

- **(Optional Supplement to be added later)**  
  *Margan’s Optimization Paradox: Theological Framing* — a plain-language explanation of MOP in theological context.
